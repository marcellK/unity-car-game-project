##A Unity game project

This is a little game I originally started developing with a friend of mine for a class project.
I've taken it upon myself to further develop the game.

It's still heavily work in progress as most of the code needs to be revised, commented, and the whole design of the game redone.

##In the works:

- More maps New sprites, UI, and menu
- Code review and optimization
- New game modes (currently you only play to beat your own time)
- Profile system & achievements? About the game

##About

The game is developed using Unity 5.3. It's a top down car game, where you race against the clock on a number of maps (currently 2).
The most interesting thing is the controls: the game uses your mobile's accelerometer to determine where you are headed,
and you can tilt your phone around in the desired direction where you want to go (pictures and stuff coming soon).
Besides the direction, tilting also affects how fast you are going (if you've got enough momentum, you can drift too!).
